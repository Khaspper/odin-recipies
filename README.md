Odin Recipes is a basic web project designed to display a collection of recipes. It's structured purely with HTML and serves as a foundation for learning web development basics.

## Features

- `/recipes`: A directory containing individual recipe pages (e.g., `lasagna.html`).

## How to Use

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.
3. Add or edit recipe pages in the `/recipes` directory as desired.
